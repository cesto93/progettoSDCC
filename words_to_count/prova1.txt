You can get started by installing Go.

Once you have Go installed, the Go Documentation is a great place to continue. It contains references, tutorials, videos, and more.

To learn how to organize and work with Go code, watch this screencast or read How to Write Go Code.

If you need help with the standard library, see the package reference. For help with the language itself, you might be surprised to find the Language Spec is quite readable.

To further explore Go's concurrency model, watch Go Concurrency Patterns (slides) and Advanced Go Concurrency Patterns (slides) and read the Share Memory by Communicating codewalk.

To get started writing web applications, watch A simple programming environment (slides) and read the Writing Web Applications tutorial.

The First Class Functions in Go codewalk gives an interesting perspective on Go's function types.

The Go Blog has a large archive of informative Go articles.
